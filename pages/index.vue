        <p>
          The Math and Science Center (MSC) provides an environment for students
          to learn and improve their background in math and science. MSC tutors
          make helping a variety of students possible by working closely with
          individual students, and directing tutees to essential concepts.
          Tutoring sessions can be as short as 5 minutes, or as long as 30
          minutes. This depends on how long a student needs. We clarify
          confusing subjects and explain concepts, answer questions, and work on
          problem-solving techniques. Tutoring is offered on a walk-in basis, or
          by appointment.
        </p>
