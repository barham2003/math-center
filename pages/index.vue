          The Math and Science Center (MSC) provides an environment for students to learn and improve their background
          in
          math and science. MSC tutors make helping a variety of students possible by working closely with individual
          students, and directing tutees to essential concepts. Tutoring sessions can be as short as 5 minutes, or as
          long
          as 30 minutes. This depends on how long a student needs. We clarify confusing subjects and explain concepts,
          answer questions, and work on problem-solving techniques. Tutoring is offered on a walk-in basis, or by
          appointment.
